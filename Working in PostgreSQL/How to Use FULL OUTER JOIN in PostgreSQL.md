In PostgreSQL, the `FULL OUTER JOIN` is not directly supported. However, you can achieve the same result by using a combination of `LEFT JOIN` and `RIGHT JOIN`. Here's how you can do it:

### Using LEFT JOIN and RIGHT JOIN to Simulate FULL OUTER JOIN in PostgreSQL

1. **Connect to Your Database**:
   ```bash
   psql -U your_username -d your_database_name -h your_host -p your_port
   ```
   Replace `your_username`, `your_database_name`, `your_host`, and `your_port` with actual database credentials.

2. **Switch to the Database**:
   ```sql
   \c your_database_name
   ```
   This command switches your current connection to the specified database.

3. **Perform LEFT JOIN and RIGHT JOIN and Combine Results with UNION**:
   ```sql
   SELECT table1.column1, table1.column2, table2.column3, ...
   FROM table1
   LEFT JOIN table2 ON table1.column_name = table2.column_name
   UNION
   SELECT table2.column1, table2.column2, table1.column3, ...
   FROM table2
   LEFT JOIN table1 ON table2.column_name = table1.column_name;
   ```
   Replace `table1`, `table2`, `column1`, `column2`, `column3`, and `column_name` with the appropriate table and column names.

   For example:
   ```sql
   SELECT customers.customer_name, orders.order_id
   FROM customers
   LEFT JOIN orders ON customers.customer_id = orders.customer_id
   UNION
   SELECT orders.order_id, customers.customer_name
   FROM orders
   LEFT JOIN customers ON orders.customer_id = customers.customer_id;
   ```
   This combines customer names and their associated order IDs, effectively simulating a `FULL OUTER JOIN`.

Remember, this approach combines the results of a `LEFT JOIN` and a `RIGHT JOIN` using the `UNION` operator. It's a workaround for PostgreSQL, which doesn't directly support `FULL OUTER JOIN`.
