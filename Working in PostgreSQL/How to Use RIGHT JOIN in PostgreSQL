In PostgreSQL, the `RIGHT JOIN` (or `RIGHT OUTER JOIN`) is not directly supported. However, you can achieve the same result by reversing the order of the tables in a `LEFT JOIN`. Here's how you can do it:

### Using LEFT JOIN to Simulate RIGHT JOIN in PostgreSQL

1. **Connect to Your Database**:
   ```bash
   psql -U your_username -d your_database_name -h your_host -p your_port
   ```
   Replace `your_username`, `your_database_name`, `your_host`, and `your_port` with actual database credentials.

2. **Switch to the Database**:
   ```sql
   \c your_database_name
   ```
   This command switches your current connection to the specified database.

3. **Perform a LEFT JOIN with Reversed Tables**:
   ```sql
   SELECT table2.column1, table2.column2, table1.column3, ...
   FROM table2
   LEFT JOIN table1 ON table1.column_name = table2.column_name;
   ```
   Replace `table1`, `table2`, `column1`, `column2`, `column3`, and `column_name` with the appropriate table and column names.

   For example:
   ```sql
   SELECT orders.order_id, customers.customer_name
   FROM customers
   LEFT JOIN orders ON customers.customer_id = orders.customer_id;
   ```
   This retrieves order IDs and customer names, effectively simulating a `RIGHT JOIN`.

Remember, this approach essentially reverses the roles of the tables. The table originally on the right side of the `RIGHT JOIN` becomes the left table in this query. It's a workaround for PostgreSQL, which doesn't directly support `RIGHT JOIN`.
