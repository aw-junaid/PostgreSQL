The `REVOKE` command in PostgreSQL is used to revoke specific privileges that have been previously granted to users or groups. This command allows you to remove the access rights that were previously granted using the `GRANT` command. Here's a guide on how to use the `REVOKE` command:

## 1. **Basic Syntax**

```sql
REVOKE privileges ON object_name FROM user_name;
```

Here's an example of revoking the SELECT privilege on a table:

```sql
REVOKE SELECT ON table_name FROM user_name;
```

## 2. **Revoking Multiple Privileges**

You can revoke multiple privileges in a single `REVOKE` statement by separating them with commas:

```sql
REVOKE privilege1, privilege2, ... ON object_name FROM user_name;
```

For example:

```sql
REVOKE SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE ON table_name FROM user_name;
```

## 3. **Revoking Privileges from Public**

You can revoke privileges from all users (including those created in the future) by using the keyword `PUBLIC`:

```sql
REVOKE privilege1, privilege2, ... ON object_name FROM PUBLIC;
```

For example:

```sql
REVOKE SELECT, INSERT ON table_name FROM PUBLIC;
```

## 4. **Revoking Privileges on All Tables in a Schema**

To revoke privileges on all tables in a schema, you can use the `ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA` keyword:

```sql
REVOKE privilege1, privilege2, ... ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA schema_name FROM user_name;
```

## 5. **Revoking Privileges from Roles or Groups**

You can also revoke privileges from roles or groups:

```sql
REVOKE privilege1, privilege2, ... ON object_name FROM role_name;
```

## 6. **Viewing Revoked Privileges**

You can query the `information_schema.table_privileges` view to see the privileges that have been revoked on tables:

```sql
SELECT * FROM information_schema.table_privileges WHERE table_name = 'your_table';
```

Replace `'your_table'` with the actual table name.

## 7. **Viewing Revoked Privileges for a User**

You can query the `information_schema.role_table_grants` view to see the privileges that have been revoked from a specific user:

```sql
SELECT * FROM information_schema.role_table_grants WHERE grantee = 'user_name';
```

Replace `'user_name'` with the actual username.

## 8. **Revoking Privileges on Sequences**

Sequences in PostgreSQL are separate objects and need to be revoked separately from the tables that use them.

By following these steps, you can effectively use the `REVOKE` command in PostgreSQL to remove specific privileges from users or groups. Remember to carefully manage privileges to ensure that users have the appropriate access levels while maintaining security and data integrity.
