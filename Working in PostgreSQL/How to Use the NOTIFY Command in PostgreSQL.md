The `NOTIFY` command in PostgreSQL is used to send a notification event to listening clients. This is a crucial part of the pub/sub (publish/subscribe) system in PostgreSQL, allowing different parts of an application to communicate asynchronously. Here's a guide on how to use the `NOTIFY` command:

## 1. **Basic Syntax**

```sql
NOTIFY notification_name;
```

## 2. **Example of Sending a Notification**

```sql
NOTIFY new_order;
```

In this example, the notification `new_order` is sent, and all clients listening for this notification will receive it.

## 3. **Using NOTIFY with Payload**

You can include a payload with a notification to provide additional information:

```sql
NOTIFY notification_name, 'payload_text';
```

## 4. **Example of Sending a Notification with Payload**

```sql
NOTIFY new_order, 'Order #12345 has been placed.';
```

In this example, the notification `new_order` is sent with the payload `'Order #12345 has been placed.'`.

## 5. **Clients Need to Actively Check for Notifications**

Clients need to actively check for notifications after they have issued a `LISTEN` command. They can do this using a polling mechanism or a notification mechanism provided by the programming language or framework being used.

## 6. **Using Notifications in Applications**

The `LISTEN` and `NOTIFY` commands are often used in applications where different parts need to communicate asynchronously. For example, in a multi-tier application, the back-end might notify the front-end when certain events occur.

## 7. **Using `pg_notify` Function**

In some cases, you may use the `pg_notify` function to send notifications directly from a SQL query or function:

```sql
PERFORM pg_notify('notification_name', 'payload_text');
```

## 8. **Dealing with Transaction Boundaries**

Notifications are transactional. If a `COMMIT` is issued after a `NOTIFY`, the notification will be sent; if a `ROLLBACK` is issued, the notification will be discarded.

## 9. **Ensuring Proper Cleanup**

Remember to clean up your notification system appropriately. For example, if a client disconnects, make sure to issue an `UNLISTEN` command to stop listening for notifications.

By following these steps, you can effectively use the `NOTIFY` command in PostgreSQL to implement a pub/sub system for asynchronous communication between different parts of your application. This is particularly useful in scenarios where real-time or near-real-time updates are needed. Remember to handle notifications appropriately in your application code.
